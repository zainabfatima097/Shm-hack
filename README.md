# Simple Harmonic Lab 

An interactive, web-based platform to learn **Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)** through real-time simulations, graphs, and experiments, without the limitations of a physical lab.

---

## Problem Statement

Students often struggle with SHM because:
- Motion is taught using abstract equations
- Limited lab equipment reduces hands-on learning
- Manual readings cause inaccuracies
- Experiments are time-consuming (up to 3 hours)
- More time is spent managing equipment than understanding physics

---

## Solution

**Simple Harmonic Lab** replicates and enhances the physics lab experience digitally.

It:
- Removes dependency on physical apparatus
- Eliminates manual timing and reading errors
- Generates accurate graphs automatically
- Allows experiments to be completed in minutes
- Enables unlimited repetition for better intuition

**Same experiment. Better understanding. Less frustration.**
